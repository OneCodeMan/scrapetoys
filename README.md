#**Scrapetoys**
imdb scrapes imdb.com for a a user-inputted tv show/movie and displays details in a nice table.
fighters scrapes for ufc.com for stats on two fighters and dsiplays records in a nice table, comparing them.
reddit is my favorite one, scrapes a subreddit of choice and downloads the first few pictures of the subreddit and saves them in a file.
